COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 - After decompressing the file, CD into the '/src' folder and run:
   * javac simulator/*.java

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:
 - The simulator may run without any command line options, as in:
   * $ java simulator/simulator Benchmark1

 - There are command line options to set the parameters of the simulator:
   * -NF, NQ, -ND, -NI, -NW, -NR, -NC and -NB;

 - There are command line options for dumping information about the simulator:
   * -dump_mem {begin} {end}, -dump_regs and -dump_branch

 - Combining simulator parameters and output options would result in:
   * java simulator/simulator -NR 4 -NW 4 -NC 4 -dump_mem 0 200 Benchmark1

NOTES:

All benchmarks are located in /src/simulator. You should not specify the full path of the program file. 

At the end of execution, the simulator prints the summary of the statistics for the program executed.
